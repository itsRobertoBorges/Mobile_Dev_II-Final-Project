## About The Project


This project is an iOS app built using Swift UI that enables users to play a card game. The game involves dropping two cards, and the card with the highest value wins, with the loser losing 25 credits while the winner gets 25 credits. The objective of the game is to reach 100 credits, after which the player will advance to the next level.

The app is designed with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to quickly understand the gameplay mechanics. The game mechanics are simple yet challenging enough to keep players engaged, and the scoring system ensures that players are rewarded for their efforts.

The app is built using Swift UI, which provides a modern and powerful framework for developing iOS apps. This enables the app to run smoothly and efficiently on iOS devices.
